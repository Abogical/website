Every member of the Redox community, from top to bottom, is required to follow the following set of rules:

1. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
2. Please avoid using sexual, sexist, racist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted words, phrases or nicknames to harass other members or people in general, and do not use a given term if someone expressed distress or concerns about it, whether in public or private means of communication.
3. You are expected to participate constructively in the discussion. Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
4. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
5. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
6. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we do not tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
7. Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the Redox moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
8. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
9. The moderators reserve the right to remove any content, they want, if they find it abusive or otherwise breaking the Code of Conduct. At the same time, moderators ought to interfere as little as possible, while still upholding the Code of Conduct.
10. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

There might be certain edge-cases, where rules might be ambiguous. In those cases, we, as moderators, will try to do our best at judging fairly with basis in this Code of Conduct.
